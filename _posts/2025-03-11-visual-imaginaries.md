Very excited that the University of Amsterdam has decided [to fund our project Visual Imaginaries of Gender: The potentials and limitations of GenAI](https://rdt.uva.nl/research/research-projects/visual-imaginaries-of-gender-the-potentials-and-limitations-of-genai/visual-imaginaries-of-gender-the-potentials-and-limitations-of-genai.html)! We will be hiring a postdoc for this project in 2025!

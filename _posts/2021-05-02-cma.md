My research is in the area of Cultural Multimedia Analysis (CMA), which brings together ideas from Multimedia Analytics and Cultural Analytics.
The figure below shows how these two fields have shared characteristics (enclosed by both rectangles) and characteristics which are unique
to either field. By combining the cultural focus and incorporation of Media Theory from Cultural Analytics, and the emphasis on developing new methods
of Multimedia, I believe it is possible to develop methods for analysing (Visual) Culture that do justice to the richness and complexity of the material.

CMA aims to acknowledge culture not only as a source of data and theory, but also for the diversity of perspectives that persons might have and the differences in meaning this can result in. However, instead of focusing on performing cultural analysis itself, the aim of CMA is to develop new methods that make it possible to perform cultural analysis at scale.

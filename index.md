Hi, I'm Nanne van Noord and I'm a researcher working on the 
[CLARIAH MediaSuite](https://mediasuite.clariah.nl/). My research interests include:

* Machine Learning
* Representation Learning
* Computer Vision
* (Digital) Cultural Heritage

I wrote my PhD thesis at Tilburg University on representation learning for artistic style, the digital version of which can be found [here](/papers/thesis.pdf).

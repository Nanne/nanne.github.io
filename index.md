Hi, I'm Nanne van Noord and I'm a Postdoc working at the University of Amsterdam and the [Netherlands institute of Sound and Vision](https://beeldengeluid.nl/en) to enrich media content with Computer Vision and Machine Learning techniques in the scope of [CLARIAH](https://clariah.nl/). My research interests include:

* Machine Learning
* Representation Learning
* Computer Vision
* (Digital) Cultural Heritage

I wrote my PhD thesis at Tilburg University on representation learning for artistic style, the digital version of which can be found [here](/papers/thesis.pdf).

After my PhD I worked at the Informatics Institute of the University of Amsterdam, on the [SEMIA](https://sensorymovingimagearchive.humanities.uva.nl/) project. 
Where I developed techniques for exploring AV archives based on perceptual and sensory features.

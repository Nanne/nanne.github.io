Hi, I'm Nanne van Noord and I'm a Postdoc at the 
[Intelligent Sensory Information Systems](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/isis/index.html) 
group at the University of Amsterdam and I'm mostly interested in:

* Machine Learning
* Representation Learning
* Computer Vision
* Digital Cultural Heritage

I wrote my PhD thesis at Tilburg University on representation learning for artistic style, the digital version of which can be found [here](/papers/fulldissertation_NvN2018.pdf).
